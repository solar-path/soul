# Authentication Guide

The Adam platform provides a comprehensive authentication system to secure your account and manage your identity. This guide explains how to register, sign in, manage your password, and more.

## Sign Up

Creating a new account on the Adam platform is straightforward:

1. Click the "Sign up" button in the header of any page
2. Enter your email address
3. Create a strong password (must be at least 8 characters with a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters)
4. Confirm your password
5. Accept the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
6. Click "Register"

After registering, you'll receive a verification email with a link to activate your account. This link is valid for 24 hours. You must verify your email before you can sign in.

## Email Verification

When you receive the verification email:

1. Click the verification link in the email
2. You'll be redirected to the platform with a confirmation message
3. Once verified, you can sign in with your credentials

If your verification link expires, you can request a new one by attempting to sign in with your credentials. The system will prompt you to resend the verification email if your account is unverified.

## Sign In

To access your account:

1. Click the "Sign in" button in the header
2. Enter your email address
3. Enter your password
4. Click "Login"

Once signed in, you'll have access to all features based on your account permissions. The system will remember your session across browser sessions until you sign out.

## Password Management

### Forgot Password

If you can't remember your password:

1. Click "Sign in" in the header
2. Click the "Remind" link under "Forgot password?"
3. Enter your email address
4. Click "Send Reset Link"
5. Check your email for a password reset link (valid for 1 hour)

### Reset Password

After receiving the password reset email:

1. Click the reset link in the email
2. Enter your new password (following the same security requirements)
3. Click "Reset Password"
4. You'll be redirected to sign in with your new password

If you're already signed in when you reset your password, you'll be automatically signed out after the reset is complete.

### Password Security

The Adam platform implements several security measures for password management:

- Passwords are never stored in plain text
- Password reset tokens are time-limited (1 hour) for security
- After password reset, all existing sessions are invalidated
- Password requirements enforce strong security practices
- Multiple failed login attempts may trigger additional security measures

## Sign Out

To sign out of your account:

1. Click your profile icon or name in the navigation bar
2. Select "Sign out" from the dropdown menu
3. You'll be redirected to the home page

## Account Protection

### Email Notifications

You'll receive email notifications for important account events:

- Account creation
- Password reset requests
- Successful password changes
- Email address changes (if implemented)

These notifications help you monitor your account's security. If you receive a notification for an action you didn't take, contact support immediately.

### Security Recommendations

- Use a unique, strong password that you don't use on other websites
- Never share your password with anyone, including Adam support staff
- Sign out when using shared or public computers
- Keep your email address up to date to ensure you can recover your account if needed
- Check for the secure connection indicator (lock icon) in your browser when signing in
- Review account activity regularly for any suspicious behavior

## Account Recovery

If you can't access your account:

1. Use the "Forgot password" feature if you remember your email
2. Contact support if you no longer have access to your registered email

For security reasons, account recovery requires verification of your identity. This may include:

- Access to your registered email address
- Answering security questions (if configured)
- Providing information about your account activity

## Multiple Devices

You can be signed in on multiple devices simultaneously. If you suspect unauthorized access, you can sign out all sessions by changing your password.
